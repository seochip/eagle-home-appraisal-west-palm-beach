                If you're buying, selling, refinancing, or dealing with estate matters in West Palm Beach, one of the first questions you'll likely ask is: How much will a home appraisal cost?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8">
                The answer depends on several factors, but in West Palm Beach, most residential appraisals cost between <strong>$400 and $600</strong> for a standard single-family home. Let's dive into what influences these costs, what you can expect to pay for different types of appraisals, and how to get the best value for your money.
              </p>

              <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-navy-900 mb-6 mt-12">
                What Influences Appraisal Costs in West Palm Beach?
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Several factors determine how much you'll pay for an appraisal. Here are the main ones:
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-4 mt-8">
                1. Property Type
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Single-family homes typically cost less than condos, multi-family properties, or commercial real estate. Unique properties like waterfront estates or historic homes may require specialized appraisers, which can increase costs.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-4 mt-8">
                2. Size and Complexity
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Larger homes with more square footage take longer to inspect and analyze. Properties with unique features, custom upgrades, or complex layouts also require more time and expertise.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-4 mt-8">
                3. Purpose of the Appraisal
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Different types of appraisals have different requirements and costs:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Purchase or Refinance Appraisals: $400-$600</li>
                <li>Estate or Divorce Appraisals: $500-$800</li>
                <li>Tax Appeal or IRS Appraisals: $600-$1,000+</li>
                <li>Retrospective or Date-of-Death Valuations: $700-$1,500+</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-4 mt-8">
                4. Turnaround Time
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Standard appraisals typically take 5-10 business days. If you need a rush appraisal (within 24-48 hours), expect to pay a premium—often 50-100% more than the standard rate.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-navy-900 mb-4 mt-8">
                5. Appraiser's Credentials
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Certified appraisers with specialized credentials (like those qualified for complex estates, litigation, or high-value properties) may charge higher fees due to their expertise and professional liability.
              </p>
